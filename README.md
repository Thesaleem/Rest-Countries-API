## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- [SpinKit Library](https://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/) - Loading animations
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript




### What I learned

Practiced using the MVC architecture I learnt sometime back, really helped with my understanding of breaking codes down into smaller structures which can simply help in debugging. Also used Parcel as a bundler to manage the modules. I also put into practice error handling and how to display it especially during a 404 error. 


### Continued development

Moving forward, I'd love to build more projects to understand the architecture better and even use a framework like React to help with faster builds.
